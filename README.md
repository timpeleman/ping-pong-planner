Developing both the **front-end** and **back-end** part of the application. 

### Must-have features

These are the most basic features the application has to have. It's possible to add your own features, or expand on the must-have features. You could, for example, let the users invite other users when he or she makes a reservation. 


1. Login functionality

   Only registered users can use the website to look at the schedule or book a game.
